# DroneComms

Multi-UAV systems often require complex infrastructure, limiting their accessibility and scalability. This project proposes an open-source, low-cost, plug-and-play solution for enabling decentralized UAV-to-UAV communication over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi using a connection-less protocol. Our approach simplifies the deployment of decentralized systems by allowing UAVs to easily exchange binary data, seamlessly interfacing with ROS 2. The solution uses an ad-hoc network that allows UAVs to join or leave dynamically without requiring centralized governance or prior configuration.
